ArcheoGram is a simple acheologist-themed implementation of nonogram logic puzzles (better known as "Picross" from Nintendo's franchise).


This game has been made in two weeks as part of a personal game jam.


If you don't know about nonograms, here's a Wikipedia copy-paste:

    "Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side 
 of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares 
 there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled 
 squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups."
